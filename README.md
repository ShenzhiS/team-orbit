# Team-ORBIT

###### In this Git repository we can publish relevant files for our research project. Each software subteam member will have their own folder if they wish to save their work to the repository for permanent preservation in case of malfunction of a Virtual Machine. There will be one central folder for the entire subteam where each, iterative step for developing control algorithms will be documented and preserved.
