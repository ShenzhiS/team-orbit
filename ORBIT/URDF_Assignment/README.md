# Getting Acquainted with URDFs

#### To familiarize ourselves with modeling robots in the ROS environment, we will be working to construct a URDF file from scratch and import the model first into Rviz, and then into the Unity Gaming Engine platform.
#### After that is successful, we will write a program (it is okay to start in C++ and then work through it in Python) that will move the joints autonomously. 
#### Finally, we will attempt to write a code that, given x, y, and z coordinates as an input, will move a manipulator's end effector to a given position.
